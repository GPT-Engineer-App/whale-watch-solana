# whale-watch-solana

Let's create a simple whale-watch app: I want you to find all whales (e.g. big buyers) who bought a specific coin at a certain timeframe. We wanna search for them on the solana blockchain. You get the contract adress as the input with the time period and then output the largest holders of that time period in a table. Display the result with all relevant infos with the buy date, the amount of coins and their highest value until they got sold. basically, we also wanna know how much the whales made. Order from highest to lowest.
